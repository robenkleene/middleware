# Middleware

![Middleware](Middleware.png)

Middleware acts as [middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware) between Ableton Live MIDI generators and transformers and JavaScript, making it easy to generate and transform MIDI in JavaScript.

Middleware provides two devices, both available in Ableton Live's Clip interface: `Middleware Generator` that's available under `Generate` and `Middleware Transformer` that's available under `Transform`.
